Hello,
I'm Robert and many

00:02.070 --> 00:05.820
of you have asked me how
you could modify the recipe for

00:05.820 --> 00:08.400
cream with molasses to
make it with fruit?

00:09.360 --> 00:10.860
I've replied to some of you

00:11.700 --> 00:14.310
on Facebook,
where I could

00:14.520 --> 00:16.590
but I thought it would be good to

00:16.590 --> 00:17.700
make a video

00:18.090 --> 00:20.430
about how we make fruit molasses

00:20.820 --> 00:23.130
so it can be documented.

00:23.490 --> 00:23.970
So

00:24.210 --> 00:26.490
today we値l do this in
America,

00:26.490 --> 00:28.110
with
blueberries.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.350
OK,
already on the fruit molasses.

00:40.350 --> 00:41.100
I chose

00:41.370 --> 00:44.340
blueberries specifically because I think
we値l get a really great color.

00:46.470 --> 00:50.700
The recipe is basically the same,
just two modifications.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.190
We値l make
the first modification.

00:53.190 --> 00:56.670
Instead of 200 grams of
milk, I値l use 200 grams

00:56.670 --> 00:59.340
of blueberry
puree.

00:59.340 --> 00:59.970
In my case,

01:00.690 --> 01:03.720
I also heated them up
to the boiling point.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.300
I add 5 grams of gelatin
hydrated in 25 grams of water

01:09.600 --> 01:11.310
and mix well to dissolve.

01:17.190 --> 01:21.240
The second modification is that
I melted the chocolate and will add

01:23.040 --> 01:25.700
the fruit puree to
the melted chocolate

01:26.000 --> 01:29.480
and start mixing
with a whisk to integrate.

01:38.570 --> 01:40.460
Then, of course, I use

01:40.700 --> 01:43.280
the immersion blender and make sure
that the cream is

01:43.550 --> 01:45.050
super well homogenized.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.770
And finally, 400 grams of
cold whipped cream.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.370
I値l transfer the cream into a

02:07.730 --> 02:09.979
bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.

02:09.979 --> 02:12.140
And of course,
just like the other one,

02:12.140 --> 02:12.890
I don't have the

02:14.000 --> 02:16.520
white chocolate or pistachio
plaque, or whatever it might be.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.210
It will need to stay overnight
in the fridge.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.660
It came out with a great color,
just as I anticipated.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.940
Thank you so much for watching.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.030
I壇 like to thank
the channel members and

02:36.680 --> 02:40.490
the supporters on Patreon
for all their support.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.060
This was the fruit molasses recipe.

02:45.050 --> 02:46.490
See you at the next one!

02:46.670 --> 02:47.000
Bye.
